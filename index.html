                Have you ever played with the Black Market card?  It sounds cool, getting to get any card in the game.  Then you realize that getting 1 card from every single supply pile takes forever!  So you don't play with it as much as you could.  This is started as a solution to that.  With this, you can create your deck, and only need to get cards out when you actually buy them, making setup and cleanup <i>much</i> easier.
