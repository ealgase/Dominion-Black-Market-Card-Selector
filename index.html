        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Have you ever played with the Black Market card? It sounds cool, getting to get any card in the game. Then you realize that getting 1 card from every single supply pile takes forever! So you don't play with it as much as you could. This is started as a solution to that. With this, you can create your deck, and only need to get cards out when you actually buy them, making setup and cleanup <i>much</i> easier.</p>
